#### Request
```json
{
    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
}
```

#### Response
The response has no body. To authenticate the player, the server must respond with status code `200 OK` and include a `Set-Cookie` header containing the authorization token.

After authorization, the token will be included in all subsequent requests to the server as a cookie.

The cookie should be used to identify the player associated with the authorization token and to prevent unauthorized access to protected APIs.
